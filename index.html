                            Crossing the Pacific Ocean and infusing island
                            culture into hiphop music, Rocco808 is the next
                            stage that Island pop has been cultivating over the
                            last few years. After making the transition from a
                            small island to the big city of Los Angeles, he
                            honed his craft and developed his own sound after
                            years of experimental projects of writing,
                            recording, and composing records. He goes above and
                            beyond, exceeding expectations creating island pop
                            melodies on trap drums and other various
                            productions. His combination of such diverse sounds
                            expresses his authenticity and his reinvention of
                            pop reggae, Afro and rap music.
